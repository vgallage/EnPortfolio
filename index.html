Why Environmental Education Matters to Me

My journey into environmental education began not with grand theories or academic discourse, but with a simple moment of connection, sitting outside during lunch at Confederation Park, feeling the breeze carry the whispered conversations of leaves overhead. That moment sparked an awareness that would fundamentally transform not just how I understand education, but how I exist in relationship with the more-than-human world.
This course has been a profound catalyst for change, shifting my perspective from viewing environmental education as an add-on subject to understanding it as a fundamental way of being and teaching. Through exploring CARE principles (Cultural relevance, Active learning, Relational understanding, and Environmental stewardship), engaging with Indigenous worldviews that emphasize reciprocity and relationality, and developing quantitative literacy skills that help students understand environmental data, I've discovered that environmental education is not about imposing human solutions on natural problems, it's about learning to live as part of an interconnected web of relationships.
What began as personal curiosity has evolved into a pedagogical philosophy that sees every lesson, every moment in the classroom, and every interaction with students as an opportunity to foster deeper connections with the living world around us.
Pillar 1: Changing Myself as a Person

My transformation toward becoming more connected with the more-than-human world
A Stop Moment
There was a particular Saturday afternoon, I had taken my lunch to Beecher Creek Park, as had become my practice, and was sitting on a weathered bench watching the water flow over smooth stones. The summer breeze carried the scent of warm earth and growing plants, and suddenly I became acutely aware of the soundscape around me, not just bird songs, but the rustle of squirrels gathering in the trees, the gentle splash of water over rocks, the distant hum of traffic that seemed intrusive against nature's symphony, and my own breathing as part of this complex web of life.
This wasn't just a pleasant lunch break; it was what Indigenous educators call a moment of relationality, understanding that I wasn't separate from this place, but part of it. The CARE principles suddenly made visceral sense: this wasn't about learning about the environment, but learning from and with it.
Daily Practices of Connection
This awakening led me to intentionally reshape my daily habits. I began eating lunch outdoors regularly, not just at Confederation Park and Beecher Creek, but finding green spaces wherever I was. At home and at school as a part time teacher, I started opening windows to let in natural sounds and light, creating what I learned to call "liminal spaces" where the boundaries between inside and outside became more porous.
Most significantly, I embraced the role of protecting and nurturing my own patch of earth. I started composting organic waste, which became both a practical act of waste reduction and a profound lesson in cycles of decomposition and renewal. Planting and tending cucumbers, squash, and strawberries taught me patience, seasonal awareness, and the joy of eating food I had grown myself. Each cucumber harvested from my garden carried stories of seed selection, soil preparation, daily watering, and the complex relationships between plants, insects, weather, and human care.
Unlearning Disconnect
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this transformation was unlearning the disconnect between my daily habits and their environmental impact. As Gruenewald (2003) argues in his critical pedagogy of place, "places have the power to remind us of where we are, and in doing so, remind us of who we are" (p. 7). My composting practice became a daily reminder of the waste I was generating and the cycles I was participating in. Tracking my water usage, monitoring the growth data of my plants, and calculating the carbon footprint reduction from home-grown vegetables gave me concrete quantitative literacy skills while deepening my sense of environmental responsibility.
I realized that environmental education begins with the educator's own transformation. How could I authentically teach students about environmental stewardship if I hadn't examined and changed my own patterns of consumption, waste, and relationship with the natural world?
Compost as Renewal
My compost heap became a powerful metaphor for this entire journey. What appeared to be decay and breakdown was actually creation and renewal. Kitchen scraps, fallen leaves, and garden trimmings transformed into rich, dark soil that nurtured new growth. This cyclical process mirrors my own educational transformation, old assumptions and teaching approaches decomposing to create fertile ground for new pedagogical possibilities.
￼
"Eating lunch outdoors became a daily practice of connection, turning meals into moments of environmental awareness and gratitude."
￼
"Creek-side moments like this became my teachers, where summer afternoons taught me to listen to the more than human world and discover profound moments of relationality."
￼
"Opening windows to let in natural sounds and light creates liminal spaces where the boundaries between inside and outside become more porous, transforming how we learn and teach."
￼
"Each strawberry from my garden carries stories of composted household waste transformed into rich soil, seed selection, daily watering, and the complex relationships between plants, insects, weather, and human care - embodying the full cycle from kitchen scraps to nourishing fruit."
￼
"Data collection became essential to understanding environmental impact - tracking daily organic waste, measuring composting inputs, and calculating CO2 emissions taught me that quantitative literacy transforms abstract environmental concepts into concrete, actionable knowledge for both educators and students."
Pillar 2A: Impressions and Growth

Becoming an Environmental Educator
Integrating Science, Math, and Place-Based Learning
This course fundamentally changed how I understand curriculum integration. Rather than seeing environmental education as an additional subject to squeeze into an already packed schedule, I learned to see it as a lens through which all subjects become more meaningful and connected. The 5E instructional model (Duran & Duran, 2004) provided a framework for inquiry-based learning that naturally incorporates environmental themes: Engage with local environmental issues, Explore through hands-on investigation, Explain using scientific concepts, Elaborate through real-world applications, and Evaluate both learning and environmental impact.
My quantitative approaches evolved beyond simple data collection to become meaningful tools for environmental understanding. Tracking my composting data at home, measuring inputs, monitoring temperature changes, calculating reduction in landfill waste, gave me concrete experience with the type of authentic mathematical investigation I could bring to my classroom. This wasn't math for math's sake, but mathematics in service of environmental stewardship and understanding.
Exploring Environmental Controversies
One of the most powerful aspects of this course was engaging with environmental controversies through the lens of socioscientific issues (Zeidler & Nichols, 2009). Rather than presenting environmental problems as having simple solutions, I learned to embrace the complexity and ethical dimensions of issues like plastic use, salmon farming, and green energy.
A pivotal moment came during a class discussion about single-use plastics. Rather than simply advocating for bans, we examined the issue from multiple perspectives: environmental impact, accessibility for people with disabilities, economic effects on businesses, and cultural considerations for different communities. This approach taught me that environmental education must be socially just and culturally responsive, acknowledging that environmental solutions affect different communities differently.
Shifting Perspectives
The most significant shift in my thinking was moving from seeing environmental education as an "add-on" to understanding it as a way of teaching every subject with relational awareness. This aligns with what Smith and Williams (1999) describe as "ecological education", an approach that doesn't just teach about environmental issues but transforms how we understand the relationship between human learning and the natural world.
Mathematics becomes more meaningful when students calculate carbon footprints of their school's energy use. Social studies gains depth when exploring Indigenous land stewardship practices. Science comes alive when students monitor the health of local ecosystems. This isn't about making everything "environmental," but about recognizing that all learning happens in relationship with place and community.
Pillar 2B: My Plan to Integrate EE in Teaching

A holistic vision for environmental education in every classroom
My Vision of Holistic Environmental Education
￼
"During our EDU 454 field visit to local salmon farms in Vancouver, we experienced how environmental education embraces controversial topics, examining the complexity of aquaculture firsthand, weighing economic benefits, ecological impacts, and Indigenous perspectives rather than accepting simple answers to complex environmental challenges."
I envision an environmental education classroom that seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor learning spaces, where inquiry drives investigation, where cultural responsiveness honors all students' backgrounds and Indigenous teachings are centered as foundational knowledge systems, and where mathematical thinking serves environmental understanding and action.
This classroom doesn't have walls that separate "school learning" from "environmental learning." Students move fluidly between investigating soil pH in the school garden and analyzing data in spreadsheets, between listening to Indigenous knowledge keepers share stories about seasonal changes and applying that knowledge to predict climate patterns using mathematical models.
Connecting EE to BC Curriculum
Environmental education principles align naturally with BC Curriculum's emphasis on competency-based learning and Big Ideas. The curriculum's focus on "understanding that all living things are connected and interdependent" in Science and "developing understanding of mathematical concepts through authentic contexts" in Mathematics provides perfect entry points for environmental education.
Curricular Competencies
* 		Questioning and Predicting: Students formulate questions about local environmental issues
* 		Processing and Analyzing: Students interpret environmental data using statistical methods
* 		Communicating and Representing: Students share findings with community stakeholders
* 		Applying and Innovating: Students design solutions for environmental challenges
Big Ideas Integration
* 		Science: "Living things are diverse, can be grouped, and interact in their ecosystem"
* 		Mathematics: "Mathematical understanding can be applied to solve problems"
* 		Social Studies: "Human actions affect the environment and economy"
Practical Classroom Examples
Science 9: Garden to Graph
Students establish and maintain a school garden plot, tracking plant growth, soil pH, moisture levels, and compost decomposition rates. This connects directly to the Life Science unit on "Living things are diverse and have evolved over time" while incorporating mathematical analysis of growth patterns and environmental variables. Students create digital portfolios documenting their observations and use statistical software to identify correlations between environmental factors and plant health.
BC Curriculum Links: Big Idea - "Living things are diverse, can be grouped, and interact in their ecosystem"; Curricular Competencies - "Analyzing cause-and-effect relationships" 
Math 10: Carbon Footprint Calculations
Students calculate personal, family, and school carbon footprints using real data about transportation, energy use, and consumption patterns. They create graphical representations of emissions over time, compare their findings with global climate data, and project future emissions under different scenarios. This unit integrates linear functions, data analysis, and graphing skills while addressing the urgent mathematical literacy needed for climate understanding.
BC Curriculum Links: Big Ideas - "Graphs and equations of relations can be used to solve problems"; "Mathematical models can represent situations and be used to make predictions" 
Social Studies: Indigenous Land Stewardship
Working with local Indigenous knowledge keepers, students explore traditional ecological knowledge and land management practices. They map traditional territories, study seasonal rounds, and investigate how Indigenous governance systems sustained healthy ecosystems for thousands of years. This connects to contemporary environmental justice issues and climate solutions rooted in Indigenous wisdom.
BC Curriculum Links: Big Idea - "Worldviews and values influence how we interpret events and issues"; Focus on Indigenous governance and environmental stewardship 
Engaging with Environmental Controversies
Authentic environmental education must engage with real controversies and complex issues. In my classroom, students will regularly examine socioscientific issues that don't have simple answers:
Single-Use Plastic Bans
Students research multiple perspectives: environmental benefits, accessibility concerns for people with disabilities, economic impacts on businesses, and cultural considerations for different communities. They practice ethical reasoning and develop nuanced positions based on evidence.
Green Technology Dilemmas
Examining the ethical complexities of green technology: How do we balance the environmental benefits of electric vehicles with the social and environmental costs of lithium mining? Students develop systems thinking skills and learn to consider unintended consequences of technological solutions.
Climate Justice
Investigating how climate change affects different communities unequally, students explore questions of responsibility, adaptation, and equitable solutions. This develops both environmental understanding and social justice awareness.
Centering Indigenous Perspectives
Indigenous knowledge systems offer foundational wisdom for environmental education. As Robin Wall Kimmerer writes in Braiding Sweetgrass, "In the Western tradition there is a recognized hierarchy of beings, with, of course, the human being on top, the pinnacle of evolution, the darling of Creation, and the plants at the bottom. But in Native ways of knowing, human people are often referred to as 'the younger brothers of Creation.' We say that humans have the least experience with how to live and thus the most to learn" (Kimmerer, 2013, p. 9).
This humility fundamentally shifts the power dynamics in environmental education. Rather than positioning humans as managers of nature, Indigenous worldviews teach us to see ourselves as learners in relationship with other beings. Marie Battiste's work on decolonizing education emphasizes that Indigenous knowledge systems offer "cognitive alternatives to Eurocentric knowledge systems" that can transform how we understand learning itself (Battiste, 2013).
Implementing Indigenous Pedagogical Approaches:
* 		Reciprocity: Students don't just take from the land for their learning; they also give back through habitat restoration, seed saving, and environmental stewardship projects.
* 		Respect for Land: All learning acknowledges we are on traditional territories and that the land is a teacher, not just a resource.
* 		Storytelling: Environmental knowledge is shared through stories that connect personal, cultural, and ecological narratives.
* 		Seasonal Awareness: Curriculum follows natural cycles rather than imposed academic calendars whenever possible.
* 		Intergenerational Learning: Elders, knowledge keepers, and community members are regular teachers in the classroom.
As Hill, Whintors, and Bailey (2022) demonstrate in their work "We are the Salmon family," Indigenous pedagogies invite "reciprocal and respectful pedagogical encounters with the land" that transform both students and educators (p. 3). This approach moves beyond tokenistic inclusion of Indigenous content toward fundamental shifts in how we understand the purposes and processes of education.
Visual Journey

Images that tell the story of transformation
￼
"Witnessing wildlife in their natural habitat taught me that environmental education begins with simply being present and attentive to the more-than-human world around us."
￼
"Spending time experiencing nature on the water connects us to Indigenous knowledge systems that teach relationship, reciprocity, and respect for the living world that sustains us."
￼
"Each meal from my garden embodies the complete cycle of environmental stewardship - from composted waste to nourishing food, connecting personal practice with pedagogical possibility."
￼
"Growing peas taught me patience and seasonal awareness - essential qualities for both gardening and environmental education that honors natural rhythms and cycles."
Conclusion: Carrying This Forward

To be an environmental educator now means to be a facilitator of inquiry-based learning, guiding students to ask meaningful questions about ecological systems, environmental challenges, and sustainability solutions. It means creating authentic learning experiences where students investigate real environmental problems through hands-on exploration, scientific methodology, and critical thinking that leads to deeper understanding of ecological concepts and environmental science principles.
As I carry this understanding into my future classroom, school, and community, I'm committed to fostering inquiry-driven investigations where students collect and analyze environmental data, track ecosystem changes, and use quantitative methods to understand complex ecological relationships. My composting data collection taught me that environmental education becomes powerful when students engage with real measurements, observe patterns in natural systems, and use evidence-based reasoning to understand concepts like nutrient cycling, energy flows, and biodiversity dynamics.
The question is no longer whether environmental education belongs in our schools, but whether we can integrate rigorous ecological science, systematic data collection, and inquiry-based methodologies to prepare students for environmental challenges that require both scientific literacy and analytical thinking skills.
